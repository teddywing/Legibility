Legibility
==========

A WebExtension that enables you to add custom CSS styles to websites. Unlike a
global user stylesheet, this extension loads a separate stylesheet for each
site, giving you control over the appearance of any site. For example, sites
with poorly legible typography can be easily corrected for better a reading
experience.


## Usage


## Install
This extension _must_ be installed as an unpacked extension.
